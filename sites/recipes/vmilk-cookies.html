                             <br>
                            No, dummy,<br>
                            you're speaking human.   <br>
                             <br>
                            - - Norm: I<br>
                            didn't know what to do.   <br>
                             <br>
                            No other bear seemed to<br>
                            be able to speak human.   <br>
                             <br>
                            And certainly no other bear had<br>
                            these weird feelings that I had.   <br>
                             <br>
                            So I went to go see the<br>
                            wisest bear in the world.   <br>
                             <br>
                            The King<br>
                            of the Arctic,   <br>
                             <br>
                            who conveniently<br>
                            was also my grandpa.   <br>
                             <br>
                            I don't know what to do.<br>
                            I didn't ask for this.   <br>
                             <br>
                            What is wrong<br>
                            with me?   <br>
                             <br>
                            Nothing is wrong with you, Norm.<br>
                            You're special.   <br>
                             <br>
                            Yeah, a real<br>
                            one of a kind.   <br>
                             <br>
                            Actually, more like<br>
                            two of a kind.   <br>
                             <br>
                            I share the same trait.   <br>
                             <br>
                            I, too, can speak<br>
                            to our human visitors.   <br>
                             <br>
                            You can talk<br>
                            to them, too?   <br>
                             <br>
                            I can.   <br>
                             <br>
                            Polar bears are icons<br>
                            of the Arctic, Norm.   <br>
                             <br>
                            And an icon with a voice<br>
                            can be very powerful indeed.   <br>
                             <br>
                            Our land<br>

                             <br>
                            and we're<br>
                            responsible.   <br>
                             <br>
                            For now, just know<br>
                            that what you and I have   <br>
                             <br>
                            is a great gift.   <br>
                             <br>
                            One day you'll<br>
                            truly understand.   <br>
                             <br>

                            Oscar for a commercial,    <br>
                             <br>
                            but as long as<br>

                            smell that?    <br>
                             <br>
                            The air<br>
                            is so fresh here.    <br>
                             <br>
                            It's completely<br>

                            That bird just pooped on me.    <br>
                             <br>
                            I think that's good luck,<br>

                            much pressure on yourself.    <br>

                            We don't need<br>
                            Greene's help.    <br>

                            I can get in<br>
                            on my own.    <br>
                             <br>
                            I know it.    <br>

                            amazing thing.    <br>

                            the water goes up.    <br>

                            fur balls in the fridge.    <br>

                            Well, it's not Macbeth,<br>
                            but it's a job.    <br>
                             <br>
                            Okay, bad costume, but he<br>

                             <br>

                            - Huh?    <br>
                             <br>
                            Mmm.    <br>

                            - I think we can take him.    <br>
                             <br>
                            A real polar bear<br>
                            always does his own stunts.    <br>
                             <br>
                            Come here and feel<br>
                            my Arctic wrath.    <br>
                             <br>
                            Jenga!    <br>
                             <br>
                            Jeez, they don't call this place<br>
                            a "concrete jungle" for nothing.    <br>
                             <br>
                            Whoa, yes!    <br>

                            Hi-ya!    <br>
                             <br>
                            Yee-ee... ah!    <br>
                             <br>
                            It was just<br>
                            a misunderstanding.    <br>
                             <br>
                            We thought you was<br>
                            a<em> real</em> talking bear.    <br>
                             <br>
                            Thank you. That's a<br>
                            fantastic compliment.    <br>
                             <br>
                            Mad rats! Mad rats!    <br>
                             <br>
                            Yes! Run, cowards!    <br>
                             <br>
                            Get back here, lemmings!    <br>
                             <br>
                            So you're here for the<br>
                            Greene Homes audition?    <br>
                             <br>
                            "King of the Arctic,"<br>
                            I take it.    <br>
                             <br>
                            Yeah. Use the Arctic<br>
                            to sell the Arctic.    <br>
                             <br>
                            It makes sense.    <br>
                             <br>
                            Well, you certainly look<br>
                            the part of a bear.    <br>
                             <br>
                            That costume<br>
                            is exquisite.    <br>
                             <br>
                            Just a little something<br>
                            I threw together.    <br>
                             <br>
                            Yes. I thought I had<br>
                            this role locked up,    <br>
                             <br>
                            but now my bear suit<br>
                            is ruined.    <br>
                             <br>
                            Oh, I'll never<br>
                            get this one.    <br>
                             <br>
                            Look, when you were<br>
                            attacking those men,    <br>
                             <br>
                            you really had me convinced<br>
                            you were a bear.    <br>
                             <br>
                            Yes, I<em> am</em><br>
                            a phenomenal actor,    <br>
                             <br>
                            but I can't<br>
                            compete with you.    <br>
                             <br>
                            Such authenticity.    <br>
                             <br>
                            You even smell<br>
                            like a polar bear.    <br>
                             <br>
                            Me, I smell like macaroni<br>
                            and sweet Vermouth.    <br>
                             <br>
                            Now go and get<br>
                            that part!    <br>
                             <br>
                            Mr. Greene,<br>

                            Condos in the Arctic<br>
                            is a ludicrous idea.    <br>
                             <br>
                            Now, condos in the Bahamas,<br>

                             <br>
                            And he even brought<br>

                            The only thing that looks like<br>
                            a bear, sounds like a bear,    <br>
                             <br>
                            and smells as bad<br>
                            as a bear is a bear.    <br>
                             <br>
                            I knew it!    <br>
                             <br>
                            You think you're real<br>
                            slick, don't you, old bear?    <br>
                             <br>
                            You thought you could send<br>
                            one of your bear operatives    <br>
                             <br>
                            to take me out?    <br>
                             <br>
                            Well, I got news<br>
                            for you, Gramps.    <br>
                             <br>
                            No way I'm goin' down that easy.    <br>
                             <br>
                            Norm of the North<br>
                            is finished.    <br>
                             <br>
                            I've got a bear assassin to get rid of.    <br>
                             <br>
                            Norm?    <br>
                             <br>
                            He's an actor.<br>
                            Never takes off his costume.    <br>
                             <br>
                            Huh?    <br>
                             <br>
                            Are you okay?    <br>
                             <br>
                            I'm fine.    <br>
                             <br>
                            I usually sit on the<br>
                            ground at home anyway.    <br>
                             <br>
                            Um... for an entrée,<br>
                            you want to do chef's choice.    <br>
                             <br>
                            He can always read<br>
                            what his guests want.    <br>
                             <br>
                            Sure.    <br>
                             <br>
                            This should be<br>
                            interesting.    <br>
                             <br>
                            Sorry we couldn't<br>
                            bring the lemmings.    <br>
                             <br>
                            A little<br>
                            health code thing.    <br>
                             <br>
                            Do you think they're okay down<br>
                            in the office by themselves?    <br>
                             <br>
                            Uh, I needed this.<br>
                            You have no idea.    <br>
                             <br>
                            This day has been<br>
                            something else.    <br>
                             <br>
                            Both the bridge and the tunnel<br>
                            were closed this morning    <br>
                             <br>
                            so traffic, was a nightmare,<br>
                            and Tony was yellin' at me    <br>
                             <br>
                            like it was my fault<br>
                            or something.    <br>
                             <br>
                            He's just mad<br>
                            because he's short.    <br>
                             <br>
                            No offense.    <br>
                             <br>
                            So... Greene Homes<br>
                            up in the Arctic?    <br>
                             <br>
                            Crazy, huh?    <br>
                             <br>
                            I'll take you to see<br>
                            an exact mock-up of one.    <br>
                             <br>
                            It's actually a few floors<br>
                            down from our offices.    <br>
                             <br>
                            You'll see, they practically<br>
                            sell themselves.    <br>
                             <br>
                            If that's<br>
                            even a good thing.    <br>
                             <br>
                            What's...<br>
                            what's that?    <br>
                             <br>
                            Nothing, nothing. Just, after<br>
                            having been up in the Arctic myself    <br>
                             <br>
                            and seeing how<br>
                            beautiful it is,    <br>
                             <br>
                            I wonder if it's even good<br>
                            to have houses up there.    <br>
                             <br>
                            That sounds<br>
                            silly, doesn't it?    <br>
                             <br>
                            Not at all.    <br>
                             <br>
                            I know exactly<br>
                            what you mean.    <br>
                             <br>
                            Oh, I gotta take this. It's my daughter.    <br>
                             <br>
                            Hi, Olympia.<br>
                            How did the tour go?    <br>
                             <br>
                            Are you loving<br>
                            the new school?    <br>
                             <br>
                            Well, it was just a tour,<br>
                            but I'm happy you love it.    <br>
                             <br>
                            I'll talk to Mr. Greene<br>
                            again and...    <br>
                             <br>
                            No. Okay, honey.<br>
                            I have to go.    <br>
                             <br>
                            See you tonight.<br>
                            Love you.    <br>
                             <br>
                            - A lot goin' on?<br>
                            - Yeah, sorry about that.    <br>
                             <br>
                            Olympia is,<br>
                            well, brilliant,    <br>
                             <br>
                            - but it's... it's complicated.<br>
                            - Good schools are important.    <br>
                             <br>
                            Yes. Really, really,<br>
                            really important.    <br>
                             <br>
                            Mmm.    <br>
                             <br>
                            Oh, thanks, Chef Kozawa.<br>
                            That certainly looks<em> fresh.</em>    <br>
                             <br>
                            Do you want to play rough?    <br>
                             <br>
                            Okay.    <br>
                             <br>
                            Don't worry patrons,<br>
                            it's just a tranquilizer g*n.    <br>
                             <br>
                            It's only sometimes<br>
                            lethal on humans.    <br>
                             <br>
                            I don't know who sent you,<br>
                            but the party's over, pal.    <br>
                             <br>
                            Mr. Greene,<br>
                            what are you doing?    <br>
                             <br>
                            You smell like<br>
                            a wild animal, Norm.    <br>
                             <br>
                            Mr. Greene, just because I haven't<br>
                            bathed, you're gonna sh**t me?    <br>
                             <br>
                            Jeez, I heard New Yorkers could be<br>
                            hostile, but this is a little much.    <br>
                             <br>
                            I'm warning you!    <br>
                             <br>
                            Ah, is<br>
                            there a sharp pain    <br>

                            and look at<br>
                            our approval ratings.    <br>
                             <br>
                            Hah! Oh, my goodness. We are<br>
                            rising faster than the oceans.    <br>
                             <br>
                            Norm, uh, buddy. I...    <br>
                             <br>
                            I thought he was<br>
                            a real bear.    <br>
                             <br>
                            I mean, I was confused<br>
                            because he smells    <br>
                             <br>
                            just like<br>
                            that other polar...    <br>
                             <br>
                            Huh?    <br>
                             <br>
                            Vortex.<br>
                            That storm brought    <br>
                             <br>
                            all the smells of winter<br>
                            right to our doorsteps.    <br>
                             <br>
                            "Real bear," huh?    <br>
                             <br>
                            You know what? Just<br>
                            forget the whole thing.    <br>
                             <br>
                            Some guy from a cola company<br>
                            approached me at Kozawa's.    <br>
                             <br>
                            Said they needed a bear<br>
                            for a holiday thing.    <br>
                             <br>
                            Because of me, your<br>
                            ratings just jumped   %.    <br>
                             <br>
                            Imagine what I<br>
                            could do for a real company.    <br>
                             <br>
                            Norm, wait.    <br>
                             <br>
                            If you let him walk out that<br>
                            door, we are back to square one.    <br>
                             <br>
                            Norm, Norm, Norm. Um, I am<br>

                            Hug?    <br>
                             <br>
                            Awkward.    <br>
                             <br>
                            Well, Normie has to look for a<br>
                            new job and a place to live.    <br>
                             <br>
                            Not all of us can afford<br>
                            a fancy Greene condo,    <br>
                             <br>
                            which I hear is fully<br>
                            furnished and uninhabited,    <br>
                             <br>
                            and I will probably<br>
                            sleep in the park<em> alone.</em>    <br>
                             <br>
                            Norm, wait.    <br>

                            leather hides from Italy.    <br>

                            we'll settle in.    <br>

                             <br>
                            Not that natural.    <br>
                             <br>
                            Okay...    <br>

                            like an iceberg...    <br>
                             <br>
                            an iceberg with hundreds of<br>
                            witnesses to watch me climb.    <br>
                             <br>
                            Hmm.    <br>

                            Janet, you're the best<br>
                            at being the worst.    <br>

                            Whatever.    <br>
                             <br>
                            You just woke me up,<br>
                            so this better be good.    <br>
                             <br>
                            Sorry to wake you,<br>
                            but I found an actor    <br>
                             <br>
                            who plays a polar bear<br>
                            perfectly.    <br>
                             <br>
                            He even smells<br>
                            like a bear.    <br>
                             <br>
                            The public will fall<br>
                            for him for sure.    <br>
                             <br>
                            Smart.<br>
                            They'll love him,    <br>
                             <br>
                            especially<br>
                            all those extra tourists    <br>

                             <br>
                            On that note, the floor plans<br>

                            are already on the way.    <br>
                             <br>
                            It's so gigantic it's bigger<br>
                            than my ego.    <br>
                             <br>
                            And we got those deluxe<br>
                            showerheads...    <br>
                             <br>
                            oh, it'll wash<br>

                            That smells<br>
                            like my grandpa.    <br>

                            I'll be too obvious.    <br>

                            Olympia, this is the great<br>
                            actor I was telling you about.    <br>

                            Yes, hi, Mr. Greene. Sorry<br>
                            I didn't pick up before.    <br>
                             <br>
                            Your mom is very good<br>
                            at her job, Olympia.    <br>

                             <br>

                            Can I?    <br>

                            maybe we can work together.    <br>

                            He can't talk like you and me.<br>
                            I tell ya!    <br>
                             <br>
                            There's nothing to...    <br>
                             <br>
                            Be honest.<br>

                            the Arctic to save it.    <br>
                             <br>

                            The campaign<br>
                            was a success.    <br>

                            Because of me, Mr. Greene<br>
                            is gonna destroy my home.    <br>

                            love it if you came over.    <br>

                            Ugh.<br>
                            You okay?    <br>

                            It's humble,<br>
                            but it's home.    <br>
                             <br>
                            You should see my place.<br>

                             <br>
                            How was<br>
                            school today?    <br>

                            and the research<br>
                            is irrefutable.    <br>
                             <br>
                            It will destroy the<br>

                            in on you like this, but...    <br>
                             <br>
                            - You're a real bear?<br>
                            - Uh-huh.    <br>
                             <br>
                            - Who can speak?<br>

                            But I need to come clean<br>
